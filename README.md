<br>

<br>
Daniel: Finished with picturea of DB actions.
<br>
Sara: I made collectible counting script and managed to get the art menu show collected item number. I also edited the main character footage and then lost my mind because github does not like big video files. And MPEG4 is a shit.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Eelis: Started scripting Migraine Morton's functions, made great progress, learnt about scripting and got stuck. Awaiting for the help of Joni once again.
<br>
Sara: I managed to export all individual clips of franks movements and figured out how to make jumpscares.
<br>
Touko: I added the doors to serve as boundaries between scenes and lost my smile and optimism. But at least we decided something important: If we survive, we're celebrating with devil's food cake.
