Cheerfully: Hey folks! Let me tell ya a story…
*Insert a Picture of Frank*
This here's you, Frank Pastel! He's an overworked corporate slave at Didnought Studios.
Marvel at how sad and gormless he is!

*Picture of the draw pad*
One day, you got your mitts on a magical draw pad… 

*Picture of Ricky Rodent*
...From this handsome devil. How is it magical? It'll make anything you draw real!
Too bad for you, you didn't know that…

*Picture of Mr. Phant, surrounded by Duckers*
...Until all 'ell broke loose. Now this fat wanker, *arrow points at Mr. Phant* Mr. Phant, who's the villain of the show you
were animating, wants the draw pad to TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

...and he's going to kill you for it. So what do you do?

*A crude drawing of gallant Sir Frank in armor rising up against a giant Mr. Phant*
Fight him?

*Chuckle* Naw. 
*Picture changes to Mr. Phant stomping Frank*

You ain't that kinda hero, bruv.

Instead, you gotta accomplish 3 things, in order of importance:

Mission 1: Get these art sheets! *Art sheet pictured* They matter. A lot.
Mission 2: Don't die! Unless it's for art sheets.
Mission 3: Get outta there!

All clear, bruv? Great! So what're you Still doing here? Get goin'!
And don't worry, I'm a bit of an artist myself, so I'll go ahead and give you directions.
*Crudely drawn smiley face*
