using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Door : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is object behaviour for doors.
    //To Do:
    //-Create an opening door script. If player manages to activate the script, they will become invincible for the duration.
    //-Create a midway save during the animation. (Loading screen allowed)
    //-Maybe reset the previous area unless otherwise stated?
    //-Or for ease, disallow going back through it.
    //-Make it despawn all objects and entities from last area and load in the ones from the next.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
