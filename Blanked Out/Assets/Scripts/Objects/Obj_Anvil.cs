public class Obj_Anvil : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the Anvil's behaviour... Which is not much.
    //To Do:
    //-Create an ability to deal lethal damage to most enemies when it falls on them.
    //-Make it so that gravity pulls it straight down.
    //-Make it so that if it falls for +6 Franks, it'll also break breakable floors.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
