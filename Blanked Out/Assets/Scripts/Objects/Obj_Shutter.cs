using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Shutter : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour script for the shutters.
    //To Do:
    //-Can we make it into a gauge that depletes when triggered by an external thing? That'd make it easier to animate.
    //-Create an open state and a closed state, with appropriate collision.
    //-Create a behaviour that looks for a signal from the linked Switch object.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
