using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Sign : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour script for signs.
    //To Do:
    //-Make it a background interactable, which displays an image on the canvas and locks player movement.
    //-Make the image disappear and unlock movement when interact is pressed again.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
