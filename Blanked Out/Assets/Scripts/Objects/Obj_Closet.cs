using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Closet : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour script for the closets.
    //To Do:
    //-Make it background interactable, turn player invisible, invincible and immobile until they press interact again.
    //-Make sure that the animation finishes before toggling the above state, so player can still die while entering.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
