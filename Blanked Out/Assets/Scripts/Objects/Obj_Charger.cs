public class Obj_Charger : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour for the charging docks.
    //To Do:
    //-Make it interactable by turning towards it and pressing interaction button.
    //-Make it recharge the drawing pad's remaining uses, but also despawn currently existing drawing pad objects.
    //-Make screen fade in and out to indicate passage of time?

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
