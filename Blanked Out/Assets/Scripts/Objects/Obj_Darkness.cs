{
    //I'm not sure if this is needed, but here it is. It's behaviour for when player stands in the shadow.
    //To Do:
    //-If player stands within its collision trigger, enemy vision cones will ignore the player.
    //-Make enemies' audio detection still trigger normally.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
