    //This is the behaviour script for any wet background elements or dripping areas.
    //To Do:
    //-This could all be just solved in Unity, but make it a trigger collider that douses campfires and bombs.
    //-Make it destroy bee clouds on contact.
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created

    // Update is called once per frame
