using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Bomb : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour script for the Bomb.
    //To Do:
    //-Allow it to be picked up, triggering Frank's "carrying" state.
    //-Create a timer for the bomb to explode. Better if it's adjustable.
    //-Create a blast radius that kills/stuns entities and breaks breakable walls.
    //-Make it so that if it collides with water or wet space, the fuse goes out and the timer stops.
    //-Make it explode immediately if sustains any damage, lit or not.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
