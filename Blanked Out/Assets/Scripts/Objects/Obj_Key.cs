using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Key : MonoBehaviour
{
    // This is the object behaviour for the Key.
    //To Do:
    //-Allow it to be picked up, toggling Frank's "carrying"-state.
    //-Make it have a damage collider that only activates while it's moving and can knock out enemies.
    //-Make it get destroyed when it collides with a hazard or the Lock object.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
