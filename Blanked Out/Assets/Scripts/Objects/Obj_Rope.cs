using UnityEngine;

public class Obj_Rope : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the behaviour script for ropes.
    //To Do:
    //-Make it a background interactable, toggles the climbing state.
    //-Make it so that the player can jump over 1 tile left or right. Maybe make it a public integer for adjustment.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
