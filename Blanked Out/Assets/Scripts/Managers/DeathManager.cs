{
    //This script manages how things die.
    //To Do:
    //-Make separate falling death and damage death functions, since they work a little differently.
    //-Respawn the player at the last door used. (Load previous save?)

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
