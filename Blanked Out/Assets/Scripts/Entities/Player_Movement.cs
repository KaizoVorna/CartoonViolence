public class Player_Movement : MonoBehaviour
    //This manages Frank's basic movement when unhindered and while carrying something.
    //To Do:
    //-Create a basic tile-based walking script.
    //-Create a sneaking and running states, which go slower and faster respectively.
    //-Create a jump script which jumps farther if player is in running state.
    //-Create a mechanic for grabbing ledges incl. pulling up, letting go, descending from standing on a ledge.
    //-Create a carrying state for when Frank is holding a bomb or a key.
    //-Create a climbing state for getting up ropes.
    //-Create a hiding state for the closets, where enemies won't see you but you can't move until you exit.
    //-Should drawing be here too? Or should it be its own script because of the charge mechanic?
