using UnityEngine;

public class Foe_Migraine : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is the script for Migraine Mortons.
    //To Do:
    //-Create a smaller audio radius that triggers from walking, too.
    //-Create an angered state which is triggered by noises. Inner radius for quiet noises, HearingManager for loud.
    //-Create a movement pattern for angered state, runs after the closest entity and attacks on contact, but won't cross gaps. 
    //-Create an ability to attack above and below, even through floors.

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
