public class Foe_Lipsmack : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This is for Lipsmack
    //To Do:
    //-Make it so that it can face any of the four cardinal directions.
    //-Create an Alert state, which is followed by an attack. Make it so that the attack timer can be adjusted.
    //-Create a 4-block-long tongue lash which can grab the held item or kill if no item is held. Return to idle state after.
    //-Create a call for death script if the held item is a Bomb.
    
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
