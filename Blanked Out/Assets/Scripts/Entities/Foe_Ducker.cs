using UnityEngine;

public class Foe_Ducker : MonoBehaviour
    //This is the behaviour script for Duckers.
    //To Do:
    //-Create a movement pattern script that supports both stationary and set movement paths. Cannot jump, but can walk on water.
    //-Create a state that determines if the Ducker is ready to fire or not.
    //-Create a state where Ducker is chasing after player.
    //-Create a firing range and raycast damage. Make sure they cannot fire while being too close to the edge of the screen.
    //-Create flee/panic behaviour.
    //-Create death behaviour.
{
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
